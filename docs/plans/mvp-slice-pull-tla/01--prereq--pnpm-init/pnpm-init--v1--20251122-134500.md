# Pre-requisite: Project Initialisation

**Date**: 2025-11-22

## Goal
Initialise the Scryscraper project as a TypeScript application using pnpm.

## Instructions

Please execute the following commands in the root of the workspace (`/Users/blaketaylor/Library/Code/scryscraper`):

### 1. Initialise pnpm project
This will create a default `package.json` file.

```bash
pnpm init
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
We need to install the following packages. Here is why each is strictly necessary:

- **typescript**: This is the **compiler**. Node.js cannot execute TypeScript code directly. This package turns your `.ts` files into `.js` files that Node can understand. It is absolutely required for a TypeScript project.
- **@types/node**: These are the "definitions" that tell TypeScript what Node.js built-in modules (like `fs`, `path`, `http`) look like. Without this, TypeScript will throw errors whenever you try to use standard Node functions.
- **ts-node**: This allows us to run TypeScript files *directly* in development without having to run a separate "build" command every time we make a change. It is essential for the hot-reloading workflow in Docker.

```bash
pnpm add -D typescript @types/node ts-node
```

### 3. Configure Node.js Version
We will explicitly state that this project depends on the Node.js v22 LTS line. Using the caret (`^`) ensures we get the latest security patches for v22, but prevents upgrading to v23 (non-LTS) or v24 (next major) automatically.

Open `package.json` and add the `engines` field:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "^22.0.0"
  }
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 4. Initialise TypeScript Configuration
Generate a `tsconfig.json` file.

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

## Verification
After running these commands, you should see:
- `package.json`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `node_modules/`
- `tsconfig.json`
